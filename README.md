# Home Animation

At the time of writing this, I've set up the bare-bones structure of the home page, with no 
functionality as of now.

1. The navbar, with the tabs injected dynamically by Vue. They have no functionality.
2. The vector logo of Kohima, to the left.
3. The carousel to the right, with no functionality.

The aim of this branch is to design and animate the home page the first time it loads.

### Animation Sequences
1. **Type One**
    1. The screen is dark.
    2. The logo fades in, full size.
    3. 
        1. Logo
            1. **Desktop**  
            The logo shrinks towards it's center while moving to the right, so it feels like
            the logo is shrinking vertically towards it's center and horizontally to the left.
            2. **Mobile**   
            The logo shrinks towards it's center while moving up.
        2. The navbar slides down. (Could do with more detailing)
        3. The carousel
            1. The background fades in, full color.
            2. The textbox fades in while the background dims.
